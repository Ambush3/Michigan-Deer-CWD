From Michigan DNR;  
 >"Chronic wasting disease is a contagious, neurological disease that affects deer, elk and moose. It causes a degeneration of the brain,  
resulting in emaciation (abnormally thin), abnormal behavior, loss of bodily functions and death. CWD is fatal; once an animal is infected    
there is no recovery or cure. To date, there is no evidence that CWD can be naturally transmitted to humans or to other animals.  "



I was curious what counties were hit the hardest by CWD and wanted to plot it out and see the data.
