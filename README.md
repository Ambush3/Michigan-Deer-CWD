# Michigan-Deer-CWD

From Michigan DNR;
Baiting and feeding is prohibited in the entire Lower Peninsula and in the core CWD surveillance area in the Upper Peninsula.
  
Chronic wasting disease is a contagious, neurological disease that affects deer, elk and moose. It causes a degeneration of the brain,  
resulting in emaciation (abnormally thin), abnormal behavior, loss of bodily functions and death. CWD is fatal; once an animal is infected    
there is no recovery or cure. To date, there is no evidence that CWD can be naturally transmitted to humans or to other animals.  

It is caused by a normal protein, called a prion, that folds incorrectly and can infect other deer.  
It is transmitted through direct animal to animal contact or by contact with saliva, urine, feces, blood,   
carcass parts of an infected animal or infected soil. Prions are extremely resistant in the environment and can stay infectious for years. 



I was curious what counties were hit the hardest by CWD and wanted to plot it out and see the data.
